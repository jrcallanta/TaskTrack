# Intro
I created this as personal tool for tracking my times for my DataAnnotation tasks. I lose track of time when I'm working, so I made this to help me remember how long I've worked.

I also wanted to see how Astro works, especially with React and an Express server.

# Instruction
To use the tool yourself, navigate into the server directory using `cd ./server` from the root and run the following command:
```
npm run buid:start
```

<lb/>

The command will build the Astro src files into the `./client/dist` directory which will then be served by the express backend.
By default, the app will run on `localhost:3000`
